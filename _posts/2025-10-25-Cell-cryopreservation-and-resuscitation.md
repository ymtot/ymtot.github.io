## Cell cryopreservation and resuscitation

### Purpose

1. long term preservation of seed cells.
2. reduce the possibility of pollution.
3. reduce the genetic variation and morphological changes of cells caused by subculture.

### Principle

With the decrease of temperature, the enzyme activity in cells will gradually decrease. At about -70 ℃, the enzyme activity is almost zero, and the metabolic activity stops, which can realize long-term preservation. However, as the temperature decreases, the water inside and outside the cells will also "freeze" and form ice crystals, which can cause mechanical damage, electrolyte rise, osmotic pressure change, dehydration, pH change, protein denaturation, etc., and can cause cell death. Therefore, the cryoprotectant glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is often added. DMSO can rapidly penetrate the cell membrane into the cell, reduce the freezing point, delay the freezing process, increase the permeability of the cell membrane, improve the ion concentration in the cell, and reduce the formation of ice crystals in the cell, so as to achieve the purpose of protecting the cell.

Cell resuscitation is to ensure that the ice crystals outside the cells melt in a very short time by means of rapid melting, so as to avoid damage to the cells caused by water infiltration and recrystallization due to slow melting. The cells with successful resuscitation can maintain high vitality.

### Instruments and reagents

1. instruments: cell counter, desktop centrifuge, CO2 incubator, inverted microscope, pipette pipette, pipette pipette, 4 ℃ and -20 ℃ refrigerators, -80 ℃ ultra-low temperature refrigerators, programmed cooling box, label printer, cryopreservation tube, liquid nitrogen tank
2. reagent: basic medium FBS、PBS、DMSO、 Trypsin

### Method

#### cryopreservation 

1. prepare the **cryopreservation solution**. The proportion of cryopreservation solution: 70% basic medium+20%FBS+10%DMSO is used in our laboratory. There may be some differences between different laboratories and different cells. 55% basic medium+40%FBS+5%DMSO can also be used;
2. cells with good morphology and in logarithmic growth phase were **digested**, **centrifuged** (centrifuged at 2000rpm for 4min) and ~~counted~~;
3. add the corresponding cryopreservation solution according to the number of cells to maintain the cell density at 300-500w/ml;(500 $μL$)
4. carefully open the cover of the cryopreservation tube with tweezers, pack 1-1.5ml of cryopreservation solution containing cells in each tube, tighten the cover tube and mark it.
5. after the sub packed cryopreservation tube is transferred to the programmed cooling box, it is directly placed at -80 ℃ overnight;
6. if there is no programmed cooling box, lower the temperature in the following order: room temperature → 4 ℃ for 20min → -20 ℃ for 30min → -80 ℃ overnight. Pay attention to keep the temperature cool during the transfer process to avoid temperature difference or melting of the cryopreservation tube;
7. take out the cryopreservation tube from the -80 ℃ refrigerator and quickly transfer it to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.

#### resuscitation

1. preheat the water bath to 37 ℃.
2. prepare complete medium
3. take a 15ml centrifuge tube, add 7ml medium, and preheat the incubator at 37 ℃.
4. take out the cell cryopreservation tube from the liquid nitrogen tank or -80 ℃ refrigerator, quickly transfer it to the water bath pot for thawing, shake it from time to time, accelerate its melting until there is still a small piece of ice (3-4mm in diameter), stop resuscitation, spray alcohol and transfer it to the biological safety cabinet.
5. wipe the cryopreservation tube with an alcohol cotton ball, and unscrew the bottle cap with tweezers. Take an appropriate amount of preheated culture medium, add it to the cryopreservation tube, mix it evenly, and then add it to the centrifuge tube (keep the gun head). Take another 2ml of fresh culture medium to wash the original tube and bottle cap, mix it upside down, and transfer the washing solution to the centrifuge tube.
6. Centrifuge for 8min at 1500rpm.
7. discard the supernatant, gently tap the bottom of the centrifuge tube to disperse the cells, and add an appropriate amount of culture medium according to the amount of cells to count again.
8. according to the recommended inoculation density, inoculate in the culture bottle, add an appropriate amount of medium, and put it into the CO2 incubator for culture.



> [!Caution]
>
> After the cell suspension is added into the cryopreservation solution, it should be placed at room temperature as soon as possible. DMSO will cause great damage to cells at room temperature. After subpackaging, it should be transferred to the programmed cooling box immediately.
